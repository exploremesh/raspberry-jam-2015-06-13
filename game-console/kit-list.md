## Optional
* Game controller. These [USB SNES controllers](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Super-Nintendo-SNES-Controller-Gamepad/dp/B00DG9KGHO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433843557&sr=8-1&keywords=SNES+Retro+USB+Super+Nintendo+Controller) are suitable for this although Xbox 360 and PS3 controllers work well if you have them.
  (We will have some controllers at the event but you may wish to purchase some for use at home)
