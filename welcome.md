# Thinqtanq Raspberry Jam
_June 13th 2015_  
https://github.com/exploremesh/raspberry-jam-2015-06-13  

## Welcome to the Thinqtanq Raspberry Jam!

The plan for the day is relatively freeform - but the goal is for you to leave having learnt by *doing* rather than sitting watching a talk! The projects we have planned are:

* A media centre (Easy)
* A game console (Easy)
* A wildlife camera (Medium)

Guides for these can be found at:

**https://github.com/exploremesh/raspberry-jam-2015-06-13**

If none of these take your fancy there's a list of other ideas at the bottom of the guide. Or you can go entirely off piste and do your own thing - we will do our best to help where we can! 

## Screens
Some of the screens have been very kindly lent to us by Sophie Dennis (@sophiedennis) and Andy Robinson (@andycayenne). If the screen you are using is labelled with their names, please send them a thankyou on Twitter!

## Social media
If you want to Tweet pictures of the event, please use the hashtag **#raspberryjam** and mention @THINQTANQSPACES.

Please note: We will be taking photos throughout the day and sharing them on social media. If you would rather not be in any of the photos let us know.
