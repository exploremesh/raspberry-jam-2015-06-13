## Wildlife camera

_The wildlife camera project assumes that you have your Raspberry Pi up and running Raspbian (SD cards can be purchased with this pre installed) and plugged into a screen, keyboard and mouse_ 
_If you are able to arrive on the day with a fully operational Pi that would be beneficial, but we will be more than happy to help with this if necessary_ 

* [Kit list](wildlife-camera/kit-list.md)
* [Step 1 - Setting up the Pi Camera](wildlife-camera/step-1.md)
* [Step 2 - Writing a script to take photos](wildlife-camera/step-2.md)
